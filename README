Possible improvements:
1) More extensive testing with different phone numbers and a larger amount of
   test data in the CSV file
2) The peak/off-peak decision is binary and applies to the whole call. If an off
   peak call is long enough to cross the transition to peak period, the cost is
   not adjusted to reflect this and the whole call will be costed as off-peak.
   The logic could be improved to calculate the costs of the peak and off-peak
   parts of the call separately and then add them together.
